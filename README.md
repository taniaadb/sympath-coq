SymPaths : Symbolic Execution Meets Partial Order Reduction - Proof of correctness
This is an implementation using Coq as a proof assistant of symbolic execution for a basic programming language with partial order reduction. To run the program, you need a current intallation of Coq and an IDE for interracting with Coq, either Proof General, an Emacs-based IDE or CoqIDE, a simpler stand-alone IDE. 
In order to run the files, an interractive use (coqtop) is recommended. In the interractive mode, also known as Coq toplevel, the user can observe the proofs step by step. The interractive mode is run with the help of the IDE. The coqtop read-eval-print-loop can also be used directly, for debugging purposes.
In Proof General, you can display the context with C-c C-t. For observing the proof step by step, you can expand the buffer with C-c C-n.
